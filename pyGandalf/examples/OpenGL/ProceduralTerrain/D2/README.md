## Get started
Run the GenerateTerrain script in a pyGandalf python environment (see the installation guide in the pyGandalf README).
From the hierachy window select the root/terrain entity

![images1][def1]

[def1]: ./images/proceduralTerrain1.png

Then from the properties window press the generate button to generate the terrain

![images2][def2]

[def2]: ./images/proceduralTerrain2.png

The scale controls the size of the terrain and the map size parameter controls the resolution of the heightmap. The rest are
the parameters of the noise, you can try and change them to see how the terrain changes.
